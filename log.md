# 100 Days Of Python - Log

### Day 0: Monday May 27, 2019
##### It's memorial Day and I was off. LET'S CODE üë©‚Äçüíª

**Today's Progress**: did the first 2 examples from [this place](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php)

**Thoughts:** Not a struggle. I'm definitely better than "beginner".
