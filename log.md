# 100 Days Of Code, Round 2 - Log

### Day 5: September 8, 2019
##### Give up or Keep Going

It's amazing. I can tell you the exact email I got the day after my last commit to this. Once That started I began giving all my energy to That. I think I've given it enough of my 100%. I'm going to have to give it something like 60% now. I quit getting up at 4am to code/study. I couldn't bring myself to tackle it when I got home because my time with my husband and son is precious to me. Until we have cars that can drive me, I'm spending 10 hours a week commuting, 40 hours working, and _if I'm lucky_ 35 hours a week sleeping. **I need more sleep.**

How do I make this work? I'm going to try this schedule this week and see how it goes:

**4am** Wake up, have some coffee, get dressed<br>
**4:30am** Go to the gym<br>
**4:40-5:30am** Work Out<br>
**5:40am-6am** Get ready to leave for work<br>
**6am-7am** Drive to work<br>
**7am-3:30pm** Work<br>
**3:30pm-4:30pm** Drive to the library<br>
**4:30pm-5:30pm** Code for an hour<br>
**5:30pm** Go home, have dinner, relax until...<br>
**8pm** Get ready for bed, hopefully asleep by 8:30-9p

My coding exercise today just to get back into the swing of things was to roll through some _very_ simple FreeCodeCamp. Tomorrow my goal is to get back into my Django blog on Python Anywhere and share my python code. I might finish FreeCodeCamp during my lunch break. That's a reach, though. 

### Day 4: May 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wrote `radius.py` and `name_scramble.py`

### Day 3: May 29, 2019
##### datetime Sucks.

**Today's Progress**: Finished `current_date_time.py`

**Thoughts:** the date. so frustrating. it works...can't say I have a great understanding of it. I'm sleep deprived and in pain.

### Day 2: Tuesday May 28, 2019
##### datetime Sucks.

**Today's Progress**: i'm struggling with the date. as usual.

**Thoughts:** why is it so hard to spit out a formatted date string? :C this makes me feel dumb every time.

### Day 0: Monday May 27, 2019
##### It's memorial Day and I was off. LET'S CODE üë©‚Äçüíª

**Today's Progress**: did the first 2 examples from [this place](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php)

**Thoughts:** Not a struggle. I'm definitely better than "beginner".
