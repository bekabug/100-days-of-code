### Day 10: July 6, 2016
##### i am back on the wagon

**Today's Progress**:
I cancelled Apple Music and got Laracasts. I'm so sleepy today and it's storming. Rewatching [PHP for Beginners] (https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners) again for the EXP

### Day 9: July 5, 2016
##### i did nothing

**Today's Progress**:
Did exactly nothing. Spent (wasted?) a lot of time trying to fix the purple dell. Bad PSU adapter.

### Day 8: July 4, 2016
##### i am kind of a slacker

**Today's Progress**:
I did very little today. I did a little FreeCodeCamp

________________________________

### Day 7: July 3, 2016
##### i am loving laracasts

**Today's Progress**:
Watched all available [PHP for Beginners] (https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners) on Laracasts (6 videos, approx 45 min). I'd not call myself a beginner but I did learn a few things of shorthand that I didn't know so starting at the basics is going to be good for me. :sweat_smile:

Did some more hacking on Atom. Explored more packages. Love it. Pigments. Yay.

One Week streak!

### Day 6: July 2, 2016
##### i am getting back to basics

**Today's Progress**:
Stepping way back. Completed 60 challenges on FreeCodeCamp (101 total). Honestly that first set of modules was so basic it was mind numbing. I made some dumb mistakes because I couldn't focus. Slogged through and I can't wait to get started in on the Javascript modules. I don't know how much time I spent on this...it was more than an hour. :fist:

### Day 5: July 1, 2016
##### i am impatient

**Today's Progress**:
More of the same. No actual coding going on today. Trying to figure out if I should finance a new Mac but the Mac buying guide says stop, do not. MacBook Pro is due an upgrade...possibly in September.

### Day 4: June 30, 2016
##### i am bored

**Today's Progress**:
I'm starting all the way over with some PHP for Beginners and it's boring me TO DEATH.

### Day 3: June 29, 2016
##### i suck ^_^;;

**Today's Progress**:
Watching Laracasts. I followed the tutorial exactly...huge error page. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Aside: This PC I'm using is crushing my soul. The display is so bad. Tried using it on a work project and the color quality is complete shit. Light pink? Double check it on my cinema display and it's actually almost orange. Dell economy displays are the worst.

### Day 2: June 28, 2016
##### what am i dooooooing

**Today's Progress**:
Lots of reading. I have no idea what I'm doing with Laravel. Time for laracasts and ...probably a book.

**Today's Agenda**:

- [x] Fork the 100 Days of Code repo
- [x] Markdown crash course
- [x] Install PHP
- [x] Install mySQL
- [x] Install Composer
- [x] Start Laravel project

**Today's Progress**:

1. I cloned my first forked repo...this one! yay! Had to get help from my codecamp FB group ^_^;
2. Getting acquainted with markdown took more time than I thought...
3. I'm now pretty well wiped out and I did no coding whatsoever.
4. Installed XAMPP - may regret later.
5. Installed Composer
6. Started Laravel project, new git repo \o/

**Thoughts:**
Found some books that I'm eager to read. I'm going to have to get a MBP. This Dell with its broken trackpad is making me miserable.
